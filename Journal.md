Apparently I was incorrect with my first wiring...

What I did:
- Changed Switch count from 10 to 6 because I ran out of GPI0 ports and don't know how to make a wire matrix
- Fixed my wiring
- Started working on the actual PCB instead of just the schematic
- Learned how to add silkscreens and added silly text :3
- Changed LED count from 10 to 4 because it was really annoying to wire all 6 together
- Skipped OLED wiring because I have no clue how to do that

# 06 - 25 - 25 (part 2 because I fell asleep :3)
Time spent working: 5 hours

I figured out why I didn't know how to install the OLED
I used the wrong one

What I did:
- I got the right OLED file
- Made the case in Autodesk Inventor
- I made the bottom 2x bigger than the top so I had to fix it
- I fixed it
- I got all the 3D models and attached them to the case in assembly
- Half of them were just floating because there's nothing to joint them to
